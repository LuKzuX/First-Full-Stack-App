# First-Full-Stack-App
my first MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) that i created, never thought i was capable of creating a fullstack website xD

I deleted the node_modules folders cuz idk how to upload them without exceding the 100 files per upload limit...

This project was supposed to be an e-commerce fullstack app, but i was studying and stopped because i use to procastinate, and when i came back to study more concepts to keep doing this app, i was kinda lost and resolved to start a new one and keep this, its a simple, but its my greatest job ever, its NOT COMPLETE, the css is pretty bad and there are pages missing and some functionalities are incomplete too, but the main ones are working.
